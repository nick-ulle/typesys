# TODO

* [ ] Write more package-level documentation.
* [ ] Add R SEXP types.
* [ ] Unify Function types by parameter name (not just position).
* [ ] Add unification methods for vectors/arrays.
* [ ] Add parameters to inject constraints into the solver (e.g., for function
*     definitions we have already computed a type for)
