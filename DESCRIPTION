Description: This package provides an abstraction of common data types, so that
    they can be queried and manipulated using a unified interface. The primary goal
    is to wrap types from programming languages (especially C and LLVM), but markup
    languages and data structures may also be supported. In other words, the types
    in this package are general enough that they should work in many applications.
