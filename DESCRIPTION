Description: This package provides an abstraction of common data types, so that
    they can be queried and manipulated using a unified interface. The primary
    goal is to wrap types from programming languages (especially C and LLVM),
    but markup languages and data structures may also be supported. In other
    words, the types in this package are general enough that they should work
    in many applications.
